# predicting-contact-variability

- Predicting persistence of genomic contacts across cell types from sequence features i.e. using calculated k-meric counts and Accumulated Natural Vector (ANV) for measuring sequence similarity
- Function to get ANV was reimplemented in C++, starting with [@JELAshford](https://github.com/JELAshford) code, referring to MATLAB code given by authors of [ANV paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00234/full)
